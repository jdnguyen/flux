This is a game using the EaselJS game engine.

A space ship shooter with a twist. Your ship cannot shoot any bullets. Your ship can however capture enemies' bullet and launch them back. The longer you hold the bullet, the faster it shoots out. But be careful. As you hold the bullets, they are still aiming to hurt you. Also your shield has a cooldown. Time it well.
